Linux Process Troubleshooting 
The production support team of xFusionCorp Industries has deployed some of the latest monitoring tools to keep an eye on every service, application, etc. running on the systems. One of the monitoring systems reported about Apache service unavailability on one of the app servers inÂ Stratos DC.
Identify the faulty app host and fix the issue. Make sure Apache service is up and running on all app hosts. They might not hosted any code yet on these servers so you need not to worry about if Apache isn't serving any pages or not, just make sure service is up and running. Also, do not try to change the Apache port on any host.


Log into the 3 app servers and check httpd service status
systemctl status httpd
systemctl start httpd

In the app servers that we found error
Check the ports
netstat -tulnp

Check the ports listening httpd service
cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf |grep Listen

Ceck the specific port listed before
ps -ef |grep 402


Kill the one that is in clonflict
kill -9 402

Check port again
ps -ef |grep 402

statt and check status of httpd service
systemctl start httpd
systemctl status httpd
