Linux TimeZones Setting
During the daily standup, it was pointed out that the timezone across Nautilus Application Servers in Stratos Datacenter doesn't match with that of the local datacenter's timezone, which is Indian/Kerguelen.
Correct the mismatch.

At first login to app servers
ssh tony@172.16.238.10
ssh steve@172.16.238.11
ssh banner@172.16.238.12
Display and set the current system’s time and timezone. 
timedatectl 
The system timezone is configured by symlinking /etc/localtime to a binary timezone identifier in the /usr/share/zoneinfo directory. So, another option to check the timezone is to show the path the symlink points to using the ls command : 
ls -l /etc/localtime

Before changing the timezone, you’ll need to find out the long name for the timezone you want to use. The timezone naming convention usually uses a “Region/City” format.
To list all available time zones, you can either list the files in the /usr/share/zoneinfo directory or use the timedatectl command.   
timedatectl list-timezones 

Once you identify which time zone is accurate to your location, run the following command as sudo user: 
For example, to change the system’s timezone to America/Toronto: 
sudo timedatectl set-timezone Indian/Kerguelen  

Run the timedatectl command to verify the changes: 
timedatectl
