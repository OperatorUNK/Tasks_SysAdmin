https://www.shawonruet.com/2020/11/install-and-configure-tomcat-server.html

The Nautilus application development team recently finished the beta version of one of their Java-based applications, which they are planning to deploy on one of the app servers in Stratos DC. After an internal team meeting, they have decided to use the tomcat application server. Based on the requirements mentioned below complete the task:
a. Install tomcat server on App Server 3 using yum.
b. Configure it to run on port 5003.
c. There is a ROOT.war file on Jump host at location /tmp. Deploy it on this tomcat server and make sure the webpage works directly on base URL i.e without specifying any sub-directory anything like this http://URL/ROOT .
d. You can access the website on LBR link. To do so click on the + button on top of your terminal, select option Select port to view on Host 1, and after adding port 80 click on Display Port.



Login to mentioned server as a root
ssh banner@stapp03
sudo su

Install tomcat server
sudo yum install tomcat

Chek what port is running tomcat
cat /usr/share/tomcat/conf/server.xml | grep port

Open the config file of tomcat server and replace the port by mentioned port
vi /usr/share/tomcat/conf/server.xml

<Connector port="5003" protocol="HTTP/1.1"

               connectionTimeout="20000"

               redirectPort="8443" />


Open a new terminal from host and Copy war file from jump host to desired server mentioned in the question
On Host server
scp /tmp/ROOT.war banner@172.16.238.12:/tmp

Then copy war file to tomcat server

cp /tmp/ROOT.war /usr/share/tomcat/webapps

Check the file has been created properly
On app 3 server

sudo systemctl status tomcat
sudo systemctl enable tomcat

Check conection from app server 3
