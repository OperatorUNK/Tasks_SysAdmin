Linux User Without Home 

The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has set up a new tool on all app servers, as they have a requirement to create a service user account that will be used by that tool. They are finished with all apps except for App 1 in Stratos Datacenter.
Create a user named javed in App Server 1 without a home directory.

a) Conect to server app01
# ssh tony@172.16.238.10

b) User creation
sudo useradd -M javed
id javed

c) Check that user is not in home
ls -l /home/user
ll /home/
cat /etc/passwd |grep javed
