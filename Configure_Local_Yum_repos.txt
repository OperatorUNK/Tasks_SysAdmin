Configure Local Yum repos

The Nautilus production support team and security team had a meeting last month in which they decided to use local yum repositories for maintaing packages needed for their servers. For now they have decided to configure a local yum repo on Nautilus Backup Server. This is one of the pending items from last month, so please configure a local yum repository on Nautilus Backup Server as per details given below. 
a. We have some packages already present at location /packages/downloaded_rpms/ on Nautilus Backup Server.
b. Create a yum repo named localyum and make sure to set Repository ID to localyum. Configure it to use package's location /packages/downloaded_rpms/.
c. Install package httpd from this newly created repo.


At first login to backup server as root
ssh clint@stbkp01
sudo su
List repo
yum repolist
ll /packages/downloaded_rpms/
Then configure local yum repos according to question
cd /etc/yum.repos.d
ll
vi localyum.repo

Add the following lines
[localyum]
name=localyum
baseurl=file:///packages/downloaded_rpms/
enabled = 1
gpgcheck = 0
Save the file
wq!
List repo
ll
yum repolist
At last install the software mention in the question using this command
yum install httpd
yum repolist
