Install and Configure NFS Server
For our infrastructure in Stratos Datacenter, we need to serve our website code from a common/shared location that can be shared among all app nodes. To solve this, we came up with a solution to use the NFS (Network File System) server where we can store the data and mount the share among our app nodes. The dedicated NFS server will be our storage server. To accomplish this task, perform the following steps: 
Install required NFS packages on storage server.
Configure storage server to act as an NFS server.
Make a NFS share /data on storage server.
Install and configure NFS client packages on all app nodes and configure them to act as NFS client.
Mount /data directory on all app nodes at /var/www/code directory (Create the directories if don't exist).
Start and enable required services.
There is an /tmp/index.html file on jump host. Copy this file on NFS server (storage server) under /data a

At first start from storage server
ssh natasha@ststor01
sudo su

Install ntf utils
yum install nfs-utils nfs-utils-lib -y
Read the question and find the directory. My directory is /code . You can find different directory.
Edit the /etc/exports
vi /etc/exports

Add the following content into the file
/data 172.16.238.10(rw,sync,no_root_squash)
/data 172.16.238.11(rw,sync,no_root_squash)
/data 172.16.238.12(rw,sync,no_root_squash) 
Save the file
wq!

Enable, start and check status
systemctl enable nfs-server
systemctl start nfs-server
systemctl status nfs-server

Check the export and mount configuration
exportfs -av
sudo showmount -e ststor01

Install open ssh client
yum install -y openssh-clients openssh

ll -lsd /data
ll /data



Now open another terminal and go to jump server (thor)
sudo scp /tmp/index.html natasha@ststor01:/tmp 
Now, Back to storage server and copy index.html from /tmp to /code folder 
mv /tmp/index.html /code 


Now go to stapp01, stapp02, and stapp03 server and do the followings in every appserver 

At first start from stapp01 server (Do same in stapp02 and stapp03)
ssh tony@stapp01
sudo su

Create the mentioned directory in the question and 
mkdir -p /var/www/code

Set nfs 
yum install nfs-utils nfs-utils-lib

Enable, Start, and Show status
systemctl enable nfs-server
systemctl start nfs-server
systemctl status nfs-server

mount the nfs server on the newly created directory
mount -t nfs 172.16.238.15:/data /var/www/code

Add the mount point permanently
vi /etc/fstab

echo 172.16.238.15:/data /var/www/code nfs defaults 0 0 > /etc/fstab

Now check the /var/www/app directory in all app servers. You can find the index.html file which is originally located in storage server.
ll /var/www/code
