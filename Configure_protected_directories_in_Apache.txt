Configure protected directories in Apache
xFusionCorp Industries has hosted several static websites on Nautilus Application Servers in Stratos DC. There are some confidential directories on document root that need to be password protected. Because they are using Apache for hosting the websites, the production support team has decided to use .htaccess with basic auth. There is a website that needs to be uploaded to /var/www/html/devops on Nautilus App Server 3. However, we need to set up the authentication before that. 
1. Create /var/www/html/devops direcotry if doesn't exist.
2. Add a user anita in htpasswd and set its password to YchZHRcLkL.
3. There is a file /tmp/index.html placed on Jump Server. Copy the same to new directory you created, please make sure default document root should remain /var/www/html. Also website should work on URL http://<app-server-hostname>:<port>/devops



Open New Terminal : On Jump Server
ll /tmp/index.html
scp /tmp/index.html tony@stapp03:/tmp

ssh on a app server According to Task

ssh steve@stapp03
sudo su

Add user name According To Task.
sudo systemctl status httpd
sudo mkdir /var/www/html/devops
sudo htpasswd -c /etc/httpd/.htpasswd anita
And enter new password in the prompt




Edit htaccess file
vi /var/www/html/dba/.htaccess
Add Below Lines into File
AuthType Basic
AuthName "Password Required"
Require valid-user
AuthUserFile /etc/httpd/.htpasswd

Move index file from /tmp to final location /var/www/html/dba
mv /tmp/index.html /var/www/html/devops/

Restart apache service
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl status httpd
Check configuration
curl -u anita http://172.16.238.12:8080/devops
