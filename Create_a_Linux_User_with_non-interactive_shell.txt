Create a Linux User with non-interactive shell 
The System admin team of xFusionCorp Industries has installed a backup agent tool on all app servers. As per the tool's requirements they need to create a user with a non-interactive shell.
Therefore, create a user named ammar  with a non-interactive shell on the App Server 1

Log inte the requested app server
ssh tony@172.16.238.10
ssh steve@172.16.238.11
ssh banner@172.16.238.12

sudo su

After login as a root now you can create a non interactive user. In the terminal, type the below comand.
adduser ammar -s /sbin/nologin
login with the new user
id ammar
su - ammar

Check user list by typing below command
cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd 
cat /etc/passwd |grep ammar
