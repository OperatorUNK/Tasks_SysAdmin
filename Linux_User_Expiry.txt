Linux user expiry 

A developer Ammar has been assigned Nautilus project temporarily as a backup resource. As a temporary resource for this project, we need a temporary user for Ammar. It’s a good idea to create a user with a set expiration date so that the user won't be able to access servers beyond that point.
Therefore, create a user named ammar on the App Server 3. Set expiry date to 2021-01-28 in Stratos Datacenter. Make sure the user is created as per standard and is in lowercase.

a) Conect to backup server app03
ssh banner@172.16.238.12

b) Create user and add expirity date 
sudo useradd -e 2021-01-28 ammar
Check user and date
sudo chage -l ammar
