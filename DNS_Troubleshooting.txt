DNS Troubleshooting

The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has noticed intermittent issues with DNS resolution in several apps . App Server 1 in Stratos Datacenter is having some DNS resolution issues, so we want to add some additional DNS nameservers on this server.
As a temporary fix we have decided to go with Google public DNS (ipv4). Please make appropriate changes on this server.


Login to App Server 1 by:  
# ssh tony@172.16.238.10

Your App server can be different. Check it from your question.


Edit the resolv.conf file in vim editor
# sudo vi /etc/resolv.conf

Add the following nameservers 

nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4

Save it and quit and save the vim file
