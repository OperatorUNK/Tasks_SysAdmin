Create a user
For security reasons the xFusionCorp Industries security team has decided to use custom Apache users for each web application hosted, rather than its default user. This will be theApache user, so it shouldn't use the default home directory. Create the user as per requirements given below:
a. Create a user named kareem on the App server 1 in Stratos Datacenter.
b. Set UID to 1480 and its home directory to /var/www/kareem.


Login to appserver 
# ssh banner@172.16.238.12
Then add user 
# sudo useradd kareem -d /var/www/kareem -u 1480 

Finally Check user 
cat /etc/passwd | grep  kareem
