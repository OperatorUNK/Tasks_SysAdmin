Linux Firewalld Setup
To secure our Nautilus infrastructure in Stratos Datacenter we have decided to install and configure firewalld on all app servers. We have Apache and Nginx services running on these apps. Nginx is running as a reverse proxy server for Apache. We might have more robust firewall settings in the future, but for now we have decided to go with the given requirements listed below: 
a. Allow all incoming connections on Nginx port.
b. Allow incoming connections from LB host only on Apache port and block for all others.
c. All rules must be permanent.
d. Zone should be public.
e. If Apache or Nginx services aren't running already, please make sure to start them


At first start from stapp01 server
ssh tony@stapp01
sudo su

Check appache port
cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf | grep Listen
Check nginx port
cat /etc/nginx/nginx.conf | grep listen

Then install firewalld
yum install -y firewalld

Enable and check status
systemctl start firewalld
systemctl enable firewalld
systemctl status firewalld

Staus and reload firewalld
sudo firewall-cmd --state
sudo firewall-cmd --reload


Now allow the nginx port that you got from finding port number before
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=8092/tcp --permanent


Allow http and https
firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service={http,https}
Allow the httpd port also
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-rich-rule='rule family="ipv4" source address="172.16.238.14" port port=6000 protocol=tcp accept'


Then start and check nginx service status
sudo systemctl start nginx && sudo systemctl enable nginx && sudo systemctl status nginx


Then check apache service status
sudo systemctl start httpd && sudo systemctl enable httpd && sudo systemctl status httpd


Reload and restart firewalld
sudo firewall-cmd --reload && sudo systemctl restart firewalld && sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-all


Check if working
curl localhost
try with httpd port
curl localhost:8092

Finally, go to stapp02 and stapp03 server and do the same.
