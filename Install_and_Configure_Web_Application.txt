Install and Configure Web Application
xFusionCorp Industries is planning to host two static websites on their infra in Stratos Datacenter. The development of these websites is still in -progress, but we want to get the servers ready. The storage server has a shared directory /data that is mounted on each app host under /var/www/html directory. Please perform the following steps to accomplish the task:
a. Install httpd package and dependencies on all app hosts.
b. Apache should serve on port 8080 within the apps.
c. There are two website's backups /home/thor/beta and /home/thor/games on jump_host. Set them up on Apache in a way that beta should work on link http://<<lb-url>>/beta/ and games should work on link http://<<lb-url>>/games. (do not worry about load balancer configuration, as its already configured).
d. You can access the website on LBR link; to do so click on the + button on top of your terminal, select the option Select port to view on Host 1, and after adding port 80 click on Display Port.



1- Check if the files exists in the given directory (jump server)
ll /home/thor

2- Copy the files into the app servers
scp -r /home/thor/beta tony@172.16.238.10:/tmp
scp -r /home/thor/games tony@172.16.238.10:/tmp

**If get an error while coping make sure you have openssh client installed on app server
For app server 1 (repeat same on other servers)

ssh tony@172.16.238.10
sudo su
yum -y install openssh-clients
systemctl restart sshd

*** After that try to copy the file from jump server again (step 2)

Check if the files have been copied to app server
ll /tmp

Install apache on app server
yum install httpd

Check apache configuration file app server what port is listening
cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf |grep Listen

Modify the configuration file to mach provided port
vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
Look for /listen in vim and change the port number

Check if port is listening configuration change is done
cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf |grep Listen

enable and start apache
systemctl enable httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl status httpd


Move files from tmp to Apache location
mv /tmp/beta /var/www/html/ 
mv /tmp/games /var/www/html/ 

Check if files are copied
ll /var/www/html

Check from Jump server
curl http://172.16.238.10:8080/beta
curl http://172.16.238.10:8080/games

**Repeat sema process in the other 2 app servers**
