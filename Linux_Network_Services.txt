Linux Network Services 
Our monitoring tool has reported an issue in Stratos Datacenter. One of our app servers has an issue, as its Apache service is not reachable on port 8084 (which is our Apache port). The service itself could be down, the firewall could be at fault, or something else could be causing the issue.
Use tools like telnet, netstat, etc. to find and fix the issue. Also make sure Apache is reachable from the jump host without compromising any security settings.

Check what is the app server failing
curl http://172.16.238.10:8084
curl http://172.16.238.11:8084
curl http://172.16.238.12:8084

In our case the app1 have the error
Log into stapp1
ssh tony@stapp01
Login as root:
sudo su

Then check httpd
systemctl status httpd

If the status is inactive then find the error by typing
httpd -t


Then go to httpd.conf by typing
vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

Uncomment ServerName
ServerName 172.16.238.10:8084

Next check which service is blocking your port by typing this command
netstat -anp |grep LISTEN |grep ":8084"

Kill the process
kill -9 pid_number

Then restart httpd
systemctl restart httpd
systemctl status httpd

Next add rules to the iptables
Sudo iptables -I INPUT -p tcp -m tcp –dport 8084 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables-save > /etc/sysconfig/iptables
cat /etc/sysconfig/iptables

Now check from Jump Server 
curl http://172.16.238.10:8084
