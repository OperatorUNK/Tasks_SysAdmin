Linux Bash Scripts 
The production support team of xFusionCorp Industries is working on developing some bash scripts to automate different day to day tasks. One is to create a bash script for taking websites backup. They have a static website running on App Server 2 in Stratos Datacenter, and they need to create a bash script named ecomerce_backup.sh which should accomplish the following tasks. (Also remember to place the script under /scripts directory on App Server 2) 
a. Create a zip archive named xfusioncorp_ecomerce.zip of /var/www/html/ecomerce directory.
b. Save the archive in /backup/ on App Server 2. This is a temporary storage, as backups from this location will be clean on weekly basis. Therefore, we also need to save this backup archive on Nautilus Backup Server.
c. Copy the created archive to Nautilus Backup Server server in /backup/ location.
d. Please make sure script won't ask for password while copying the archive file. Additionally, the respective server user (for example, tony in case of App Server 1) must be able to run it.

At first login to app server02
ssh banner@stapp02
Then go to scripts folder and create media_backup.sh
cd /scripts
ll
vi beta_backup.sh


Next write this commands and save it
#!/bin/bash

zip -r /backup/xfusioncorp_beta.zip /var/www/html/beta
scp /backup/xfusioncorp_beta.zip clint@172.16.238.16:/backup/

Then create a keygen and copy the key to backup server so that bash script will not require any password
ssh-keygen
ssh-copy-id clint@172.16.238.16
Finally go to scripts folder and run the bash scripts by this command
cd /scripts
chmod +x news_backup.sh
sh news_backup.sh 
Now you can check the backup folder for the zip file on both app03 and backup server. If you find the zip file then it should be done.
Log into backup server
ssh clint@172.16.238.16
cd /backup
ll
