On Nautilus storage server in Stratos DC there is a storage location /data which is used by different developers to keep their data (no confidential data). One of the developers yousuf has raised a ticket and asked for a copy of his/her data present in /data/yousuf directory on storage server. /home is an FTP location on storage server where developers can download their data. Below are the instructions shared by the system admin team to accomplish the task:
Make a yousuf.tar.gz compressed archive of /data/yousuf directory and move the archive to /home directory on Storage Server.

a) Connect to Storege server
# ssh natasha@172.16.238.15

b) Navigate to the directory of the requested file
# cd /data/yousuf

c) Compress the requested directory
# sudo tar -cvzf yousuf.tar.gz /data/yousuf
# ll

d)Move the compressed file to the /home location
# mv yousuf.tar.gz /home/

e) Check if the tar file moved properly to /home
# cd /home/
# ll
