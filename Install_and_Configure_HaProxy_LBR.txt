Install and Configure HaProxy LBR
There is a static website of Nautilus project running in Stratos Datacenter. Based on the infrastructure, they have already configured app servers and code is already deployed there. To make it work properly, they need to configure LBR server. There are number of options for that, but team has decided to go with HAproxy.
a. So install and configure HAproxy on LBR server using yum only and make sure all app servers are added to HAproxy load balancer. HAproxy must serve on default http port (Note: Please do not remove stats socket /var/lib/haproxy/stats entry from haproxy default config.).
b. You can access the website on LBR link—to do so click on the + button on top of your terminal, select option Select port to view on Host 1, and after adding port 80 click on Display Port.

At first find the port numbers of  app01
ssh tony@172.16.238.10
cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf| grep Listen
Then Enable, start and check status
systemctl enable httpd 
systemctl start httpd 
systemctl status httpd
Find the port numbers of  app02
ssh steve@172.16.238.11
cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf| grep Listen
Then Enable, start and check status
systemctl enable httpd 
systemctl start httpd 
systemctl status httpd
Find the port numbers of  app02
ssh banner@172.16.238.12
cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf| grep Listen
Then Enable, start and check status
systemctl enable httpd 
systemctl start httpd 
systemctl status httpd
Next login to LBR server and do the followings

sudo su
yum -y install haproxy
cat /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg |grep haproxy/stats
vi /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg
Find / frontend and make the following changes

Save the changes in the file !wq

haproxy -f /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg 
systemctl enable haproxy 
systemctl start haproxy 
systemctl status haproxy
From jump host check if everything is working
curl 172.16.238.10:6000
curl 172.16.238.11:6000
curl 172.16.238.12:6000
