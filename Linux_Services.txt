Linux Services 

As per details shared by the development team, the new application release has some dependencies on the back end. There are some packages/services that need to be installed on all app servers under Stratos Datacenter. As per requirements please perform the following steps:

Access the application servers (app01)
# ssh tony@172.16.238.10
a) Install cups package on all the application servers.
# sudo yum -y install cups
# sudo systemctl start cups
# sudo systemctl status cups 
b) Once installed, make sure it is enabled to start during boot.
# sudo systemctl enable cups 
# sudo systemctl status cups 

Repeat the same above on the application servers (app02, app03)
