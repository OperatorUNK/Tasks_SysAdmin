Linux Resource Limits

On our Storage server in Stratos Datacenter we are having some issues where nfsuser user is holding hundred of processes, which is degrading the performance of the server. Therefore, we have a requirement to limit its maximum processes. Please set its maximum process limits as below:
a. soft limit = 78
b. hard_limit = 100

Login to storage server at first
ssh natasha@172.16.238.15
Then type this command
# vi /etc/security/limits.conf
Type i for insert mode in editor and add the following lines
nfsuser soft nproc 78
nfsuser hard nproc 100
Now press ESC button and write :wq! to exit editor
Finally check the limits by typing this command
cat /etc/security/limits.conf | grep nproc | grep -v ^#
