Install a package
As per new application requirements shared by the Nautilus project development team, serveral new packages need to be installed on all app servers in Stratos Datacenter. Most of them are completed except for telnet.
Therefore, install the telnet package on all app-servers.

Login to all app servers one by one and run install command
ssh tony@172.16.238.10  Ir0nM@n
sudo yum install telnet
 
ssh steve@172.16.238.11  Am3ric@
sudo yum install telnet
