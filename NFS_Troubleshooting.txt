NFS Troubleshooting
The Nautilus production support team was trying to fix issues with their storage server. The storage server has a shared directory /appdata, which is mounted on all app servers at location /var/www/html so that whatever data they store on storage server under /appdata can be shared among all app servers. Somehow NFS server is broken and having some issues.
Identify the root cause of the issue and fix it to make sure sharing works fine among all app servers and storage server.

Login to storage server
 # ssh natasha@172.16.238.15

Enable nfs-server and rpcbind. Then check 
# sudo systemctl enable nfs-server
# sudo chkconfig nfs-server on
# sudo systemctl enable rpcbind
# sudo chkconfig rpcbind on

Start nfs server and rpcbind and check status 
# sudo systemctl start nfs-server
# sudo systemctl status nfs-server

# sudo systemctl start rpcbind
# sudo systemctl status rpcbind

Now edit exports file 

# sudo vi /etc/exports

Press i button and write 

/appdata 172.16.238.10(rw,sync,no_root_squash)
/appdata 172.16.238.11(rw,sync,no_root_squash)
/appdata 172.16.238.12(rw,sync,no_root_squash) 

Press ESC button and then type :wq! 

Now type this command
# sudo exportfs -a

Then run show mount command to check the listed servers 
# sudo showmount -e ststor01

Open 3 new terminals for 3 appservers and do the followings in every app server 

Repeat enable, check config and start, status commands for nfs-server and rpcbind like you did in storage server 

Next, mount and check nfs 
# sudo mount -t nfs ststor01:/appdata /var/www/html
# dh -f

mount | grep nfs

Do this in all app servers and make sure that you have found nfs on mount with rw, realtime finally.
